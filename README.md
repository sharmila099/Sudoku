# Sudoku Game Solver

Create a Sudoku game solver using Python. 
* This problem is an example of what is called a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) in the field of Artificial Intelligence. CSP is a mathematical problem that must satisfy a number of constraints or limitations all the time. 
* The Backtracking algorithm is also used to solve CSPs, in a Sudoku game. Backtracking is a recursive algorithm that tries to build a solution incrementally, removing solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints.
